Game Story:
You are a wizard who is physically weaker than the others but with magic you can turn the tables. 
You can a turn into a Voodoo and then turn your opponent's strength against themself. In other words, 
you can lose (take damage deliberately in voodoo mode) in order to win (kill your opponents)!

GamePlay: 
In this game, there are four different enemies shown with different tint (green, red, blue, yellow). 
They have different behaviours and are always in patrol mode until when the player get close to it. 

Green - Melee only. (Starts chasing player within a distance)
Blue - Shooting only. (Withing a certain distance from player, it will start moving closer to player 
	before stopping and shooting.)
Red - Melee & Shooting. (Withing a certain distance from player, it will start moving closer to player 
	before stopping and shooting. If the player move any closer to it, it will start moving close to the 
	player and attack player with melee).
Yellow - Shooting only. (Will chase player all the time).

Enemies can be pushed away if you are being cornered or unable to run away from enemy. Some objects like boxes 
are movable which can be moved out of the way to clear the path or used as a shield!
